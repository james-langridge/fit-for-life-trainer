This is a marketing website for a personal trainer (PT) made in TypeScript with Next.js v13, React v18, Tailwind CSS, and Contentful (headless CMS) integration.  It gives the site owner complete flexibility to create and add content to new pages via Contentful, which are then statically generated (Static Site Generation), and revalidated on-demand when updated (Incremental Static Regeneration).

## TODO
- [ ] Add tests
- [ ] Create login area where site owner can assign training programs to clients
